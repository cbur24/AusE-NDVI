# AusENDVI: A long-term NDVI dataset for Australia 

AusENDVI (**Aus**tralian **E**mprical **NDVI**) is a monthly, 5-km gridded estimate of NDVI across Australia from 1982-2022. It is built by calibrating and harmonising NOAA's Climate Data Record AVHRR NDVI data to MODIS MCD43A4 NDVI using a gradient boosting ensemble decision tree method.Â  Additionally, the datasets are gapfilled using a machine-learning derived synthetic NDVI dataset. 

<!-- The methods are extensively described in the Earth System Science Data (pre)-publication here. -->

The datasets are available for download through zenodo
